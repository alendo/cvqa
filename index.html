            <h3>Manual Testing</h3>
            <p>Manual testing is a software testing process in which test cases are executed manually without using any automated tool. All test cases executed by the tester manually according to the end user's perspective. It ensures whether the application is working, as mentioned in the requirement document or not. Test cases are planned and implemented to complete almost 100 percent of the software application. Test case reports are also generated manually.</p>

            <h3>Test Planning</h3>
            <p class="desc1"> test plan for software describes what's going to happen, how long it will take, who is going to do it, what it will be done to, and what we expect to come of it. Think of it as a very detailed way to carry out the testing of a piece of software so we can be sure we have covered all the angles. The overall software testing process also has many other formal procedures, but the plan is where we begin.

                The plan is very important, because it summarizes the testing process. The plan is broken down into manageable pieces so we know how to deal with each aspect of that process. And it's a record of our objectives, so we can look back and see how we did.</p>

            <h3>API Testing</h3>
            <p>API testing is a type of software testing that analyzes an application program interface (API) to verify it fulfills its expected functionality, security, performance and reliability. The tests are performed either directly on the API or as part of integration testing.</p>

            <h3>Automation Testing</h3>
            <p>Automated testing is a process that validates if software is functioning appropriately and meeting requirements before it is released into production. This software testing method uses scripted sequences that are executed by testing tools.</p>
